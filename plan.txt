Move circuit
    Format: $xxx#          b ->                     b xxx  $

Start symbol #
End Symbol $
Control Symbol ?

Input Format:
Space separated list of 

a 110101 b 101010

Each data point is converted into a space separated list of units
    Each unit is x-oooo where x is the charachter

    ex. a-ooo b-oooo
    
Control is the character to the left of $
Move no longer moves $, after finding that there are no more characters, move goes right until it finds $, then goes left one to control
This circuit forces huffman_encoding to leave two spaces, and merge will ultimately leave three => two_smallest and merge must be able to work with variable amount of whitespace

Need a copy circuit for just ones and zeros
But to store order, need a copy circuit for entire language

To do:
    Make it so each letter is put in parentheses
    Clean after merge
    Unmerge
    Clean after Unmerge
    Reorder -> Make it so all alphabet dependent text is written into the individual files and then all is copied into a single global file
